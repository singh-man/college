<P>One of AutoCAD's greatest assets is its adaptability. You can
control just about every aspect of AutoCAD's operations from the
appearance of its drawing editor to its variety of menus. A key
element of this adaptability is its built-in programming language,
AutoLISP. With AutoLISP, you can virtually write your own commands or
redefine others.</P>

<P>You can think of AutoLISP as a very sophisticated macro-building
facility. (Simple macros are like scripts that automate repetitive
keystrokes.) You don't need to be a programmer to use AutoLISP. In
fact, AutoLISP is designed so that everyday users of AutoCAD can
start to use it after a minimum of training. This book makes AutoLISP
accessible to AutoCAD users who are looking for a way to enhance and
extend their use of AutoCAD.</P>

book</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>This book introduces nonprogrammers to the use of AutoLISP. If you
are an intermediate level AutoCAD user, interested in learning about
this powerful tool, then this is the book for you. If you are just
beginning to learn AutoCAD, then you should probably become a bit
more familiar with AutoCAD before attempting to learn AutoLISP. This
book assumes that you have at least an intermediate level of
expertise with AutoCAD and are acquainted with simple Windows
operations.</P>

Organized</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>The book is divided into 11 chapters. The first three chapters
give you an introduction to programming in AutoLISP. The
<A HREF="Chapter%201.htm">Chapter 1</A> introduces you to AutoLISP by
showing you how to use it directly from the AutoCAD command prompt.
The <A HREF="Chapter%202.htm">Chapter 2</A> shows you how to create
and save programs in a file. <A HREF="Chapter%203.htm">Chapter 3</A>
discusses ways of organizing your programming projects and how to
manage your computers' memory.</P>

<P>The next four chapters show you how to use AutoLISP to do a
variety of editing tasks. <A HREF="Chapter%204.htm">Chapter 4</A>
discusses the functions that allow you to ask the user for input.
<A HREF="Chapter%205.htm">Chapter 5</A> explains how to build
decision-making capabilities into your programs<FONT
COLOR="#FF0000">. </FONT><FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Chapter%206.htm">Chapter 6</A></FONT> shows
you how to deal with geometric problems using AutoCAD. <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Chapter%207.htm">Chapter 7</A></FONT>
discusses the manipulation of text.</P>

<P>The last four chapters show you how AutoCAD and AutoLISP interact.
In <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Chapter%208.htm">Chapter
8</A></FONT>, you will see how you can control many facets of AutoCAD
through AutoLISP. <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Chapter%209.htm">Chapter 9</A></FONT> delves
into lists, a fundamental component of all AutoLISP programs. <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Chapter%2010.htm">Chapter 10</A></FONT>
shows you ways of modifying AutoCAD objects by directly accessing the
AutoCAD drawing database. And finally, <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Chapter%2011.htm">Chapter 11</A></FONT>
looks at ways to dig deeper into the drawing database to get
information on complex drawing objects like polylines and block
attributes.</P>

<P>In addition, five appendices are included as reference material to
the book. In the original version of this book, these appendices
contained the resources indicated by their title. In this electronic
version, these appendices offer directions on how to find information
in the AutoCAD help system. The first three show you how to find
information on the <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Appendix%20A.htm">AutoCAD menu
structure</A></FONT>, <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Appendix%20B.htm">AutoLISP error
messages</A></FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">and </FONT><FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Appendix%20C.htm">AutoCAD group
codes</A></FONT>. The fourth appendix describes how to find
informaton on the standard <FONT
COLOR="#FF0000"><A HREF="Appendix%20D.htm">AutoCAD dimension
variables and system variables</A></FONT>. The fifth appendix
describes how to find informaton on the
<A HREF="Appendix%20E.htm">Table group codes.</A></P>

Book</FONT></I></B></P>

<P>Each chapter offers exercises and sample programs that demonstrate
some general concept regarding AutoLISP. Through these exercises, the
book shows you how programs develop from ideas into finished, running
programs. Also, the information you learn in one chapter will build
on what you learned in the previous chapter. This way, your knowledge
of AutoLISP will be integrated and cohesive, rather than fragmented.
For this reason, the best way to use this book is to read each
chapter in order and do all of the exercises. Since the topics are
oriented toward accomplishing tasks rather than simply focusing on
individual functions, you will have a good grasp of how to use
AutoLISP in real world situations by the end of this book.</P>

<P>As you read the chapters and do the exercise, you will be asked to
enter program code into a file. If you are in a hurry, you can cut
and paste the code directly from the chapter you are reading. This
will save a good deal of time, but make sure you study the code that
you cut and paste.</P>
